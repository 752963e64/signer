# signer.privkey() - creates a directory then generate and install a private key.
# signer.pubkey() - creates a public key from your private key (optionally generate one if there is none)
# signer.sign() - the signing interface that uses private key
# signer.verify() - authenticates file from public key with signature
# signer.sign.sha1() - signs data using sha1
